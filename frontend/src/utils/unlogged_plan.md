# Hey there!

Have you ever wanted to try something new?
We all've been there... You start it, maybe try couple days, and then abandon it... The thing is, it's pretty easy to start, but can you keep up the pace?
It is believed that a habit forms in 66 days. So, I've designed an app to keep track of my own habits, hoping it will help me to focus on my skills as a developer. 
If you read this message, it means that I've succeeded in my goal. Hope, you will success in yours!
